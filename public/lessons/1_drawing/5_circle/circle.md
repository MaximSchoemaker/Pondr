Tired of lines? How about the some circles!
```
circle(x, y, diameter)
```
The [circle](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/circle) function draws a circle centered on `x` and `y` with a specific `diameter`
---
Use the [fill](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/fill) function to set the colour used to fill the circle.
```
fill(red, green, blue)
```
---
Use [noStroke](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/nostroke) to draw a circle with no outline.
```
noStroke()
```
Use [noFill](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/nofill) to draw a circle with no filling.
```
noFill()
```
---
Challenge! How large does the middle circle need to be to contain the other circles.
