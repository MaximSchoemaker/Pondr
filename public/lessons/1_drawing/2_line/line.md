To draw a line on the canvas we can use the [line](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/line) function:
```
line(x1, y1, x2, y2)
```
---
It takes 4 arguments: 
- The starting coordinate of the line: `x1, y1`
- The ending coordinate of the line: `x2, y2`

---
The x axis goes from left to right.
The y axis goes from top to bottom.

coordinate `0, 0` is top left.
coordinate `200, 200` is bottom right.

---
Challenge! Draw another line and make a cross.
