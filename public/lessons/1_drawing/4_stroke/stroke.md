To change the colour of the line we can use the [stroke](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/stroke) function:
```
stroke(red, green, blue)
```
---
Same as `strokeWeight`, the `stroke` colour applies to every draw call after it. To draw with different colours we can call `stroke` multiple times.

Challenge! Draw the <span style="color:#FF0088">`magenta`</span> line on top of the <span style="color:#8800FF">`purple`</span> line.
