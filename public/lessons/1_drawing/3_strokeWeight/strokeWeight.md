As you might have noticed the line is a little thin...

To make the line nice and beefy we can use the [strokeWeight](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/strokeWeight) function:
```
strokeWeight(weight)
```
---
The new stroke weight will be used for every draw function called after the `strokeWeight` function.

---
Challenge! Draw the first line with stroke weight `5` and second line with weight `20`.
