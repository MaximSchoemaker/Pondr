Use the [rect](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rect) function to draw a rectangle:
```
rect(x, y, width, height)
```
---
`rect` draws a rectangle that:
- starts at `x` and `y` (top left corner)
- with dimensions `width` and `height`
---
`strokeWeight` , `stroke` , `fill` , `noStroke` and `noFill` all apply to `rect` as well.
---
Challenge! Draw a rectangle with a stroke and no fill that contains everything.
