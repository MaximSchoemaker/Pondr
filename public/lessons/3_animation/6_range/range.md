You can alter the range of a signal by multiplying it by a constant, like so:
```
let y1 = sinn(t) * 0.5
```
Now it goes from `0` to `0.5`
---
To offset the whole range you can add a constant, like so:
```
let y1 = sinn(t) * 0.5 + 0.25
```
Now it goes from `0.25` to `0.75`

Challenge! 
- Give `y1`'s signal a range of `0` to `0.5`
- Give `y2`'s signal a range of `0.25` to `0.75`
- Give `y3`'s signal a range of `0.5` to `1`
