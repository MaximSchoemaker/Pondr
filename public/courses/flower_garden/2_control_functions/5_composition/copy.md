When our flower gets more complicated, it is nice to keep things organized. Define your own functions to help indicate what the code does.
---
In this case: `my_garden` calls `my_flower`, which draws the 3 parts of the flower:
- `my_leaves`: draws the 2 green leaves
- `my_stem`: draws the stem with a wiggle
- `my_bud`: draws the petals and bud
---
Besides helping organise, defining your own functions also allows for composition with the 4 control functions: `repeat`, `ring`, `fork`, and `branch`
---
Challenge!
- Put `my_flower` inside `fork` like so: `fork(my_flower)`
- Try out `ring` and `repeat` as well!
- Go make your own beautiful creation! ðŸŒ·ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ»
