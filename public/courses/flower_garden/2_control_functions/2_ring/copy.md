Repeat is pretty cool, but what if I want to repeat in a circle?
---
Use `ring(petal)` to make a ring of petals!

Just like repeat, ring has a count property, as well as a radius property:
- `ring_count = 10`
- `ring_radius = 1`
---
Challenge!
- Use `mouse_y` to figure out how `ring_radius` works.
- Set `ring_count` to `10 * mouse_x` and move your mouse around âœ¨
