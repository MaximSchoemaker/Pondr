Rings are great for flowers, but what about leaves?
---
Use `fork(petal)` to make two leaves
---
fork also has a count property, as well as an angle property:
- `fork_count = 4`
- `fork_angle = 1 / 2`
---
Challenge!
- Change `ring(petal)` to `fork(petal)`
- Add `fork_angle` set it to `mouse_x` and see what happens! âœ¨
- Add `fork_count` and try out different numbers...
