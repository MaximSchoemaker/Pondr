Flowers come in all shapes and sizes.
---
All 3 elements have length, width and size. For example:
- `stem_length = 1`
- `bud_width = 1 / 2`
- `petal_size = 2`
---
Stem has a special property called `bend`
Use it like so: `stem_bend = 1 / 10`

Challenge!
- Change around the length, width and size of the elements...
- Try to make the stems curl all the way around! ðŸ¥€
