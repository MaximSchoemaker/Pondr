Flowers come in all different colours, of course! ðŸŽ¨

To change the color of the stem, bud or petal to red use:
- `stem_color = "red"`
- `bud_color = "red"`
- `petal_color = "red"`
---
You can recognize the colours in the code by their double quotes (<span style="color:yellow">`"`</span>) and <span style="color:yellow">yellow</span> text
