When we put a petal in a ring, in programming we call `petal` an argument of the function `ring`
---
Until now we've only been passing 1 argument to ring, but it is possible to pass more than one ðŸ¤¯
---
We do so my putting a `,` in between the arguments. For example:
- `ring(petal, stem)`
- `repeat(petal, stem, bud)`
- `fork(petal, bud, stem, my_bud)`

---
Challenge!
- Change `ring(petal)` into `ring(petal, stem)`
