But what if we want even more control? 
In comes special variable: `f`âœ¨
---
`f` stand for fraction. It tells you how far along you are inside a `repeat`, `ring` or `fork` call. It's value goes from 0 at the start to 1 at the end.

Challenge!
- Change `petal_size = f` to `petal_size = f + mouse_x` and move around your mouse.
- Now change it to `f * mouse_x` 
`*` is used in code for multiplication. 
Can you tell the difference between `+` and `*` ?
