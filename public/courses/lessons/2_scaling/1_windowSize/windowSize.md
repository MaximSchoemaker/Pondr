Our canvas has been a bit small and we have more space available...

To make the canvas fit the window we can use the variables:
```
windowWidth
windowHeight
```
---
- `windowWidth` holds the width of the sketch's container.
- `windowHeight` holds the height of the sketch's container.
---

Challenge! Set the canvas width and height to `windowWidth` and `windowHeight`
