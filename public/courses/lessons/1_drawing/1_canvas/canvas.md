To start drawing we first create a canvas, using the [createCanvas](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createCanvas) function:

```
createCanvas(width, height)
```
It takes 2 arguments: `width` and `height` 

We'll start by setting both to `200` to create a square.

---

Then we'll colour the canvas, using the [background](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/background) function:
```
background(red, green, blue)
```
The `red` , `green` and `blue` values get combined into a single colour. Similar to blending colours with paint, but using green instead of yellow.

Give this colour picker a go to see how RGB works:  <input type="color" placeholder="#FF8800" />

Challenge! See if you can change the colour to <span style="color:#FF0088">`magenta`</span>
Edit the code and press <span class="icon-play3"></span>Play to see the changes.
