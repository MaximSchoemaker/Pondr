By drawing a line from each points on the circle to the next we can create a polygon!
---
We already have the first point. To get the next point we need the next value of `iFract`
```
let iFractNext = (i + 1) / count
```
`iFactNext` can then be used to calculate the second `x` and `y` coordinates.

Challenge! 
- First try to image what is going to happen...
- Change `count` to `3`
- ...
- Did you see the future?
