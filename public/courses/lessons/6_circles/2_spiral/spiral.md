If we put `iFract` in the `radius` every next circle will be drawn one step furter away from the center. Creating a spiral :o

The `angle` takes the `iFract`, which goes from `0` to `1` creating one full angle cycle. If we multiply this by numbers higher than `1` it will loop around itself and create interesting patterns...

Challenge! 
- Multiply `angle`'s `iFract` by some numbers and see what happens.
